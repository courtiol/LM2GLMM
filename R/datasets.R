#' Sample from the Ten-Year Follow-up (1980) of the 1970 British Cohort Study
#'
#' This dataset is a sample of few variables taken from the Ten-Year Follow-up
#' (1980) of the 1970 British Cohort Study (BSC70).
#'
#' The BCS70 began in 1970 when data were collected about the 17,198 babies born
#' in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the week 5-11 April.
#'
#' At this time, the study was named the British Births Survey (BBS) and it was
#' sponsored by the National Birthday Trust Fund, in association with the Royal
#' College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
#'
#' Since 1970, there have been four attempts to gather information from the full
#' cohort - when they were aged 5, 10, 16 and 26 years. 90% of the 1970 Cohort
#' were traced and completed one or more survey documents.
#'
#' In 1975 and 1980, the cohort was augmented by the inclusion of immigrants to
#' Britain who were born in the target week in 1970. Subjects from Northern
#' Ireland who had been included in the birth survey, were dropped from the
#' study in all subsequent sweeps.
#'
#' The BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up is the second full national follow-up of the
#' 1970 cohort born in Great Britain 5-11 April 1970. The cohort has been
#' surveyed comprehensively at birth, five, ten, 16 and 26 years, and samples
#' were seen at 22 months, 42 months, seven and 21 years. The BCS70 Ten-year
#' Follow-up was originally titled the Child Health and Education Study (CHES),
#' but in 1991 the whole 1970 Cohort Study was renamed the British Cohort Study
#' 1970 (BCS70) and the ten-year sweep became known as BCS70 Ten-year Follow-up.

#' The Challenger Space Shuttle O-Ring Dataset
#'
#' Edited from (Draper, 1993): The motivation for collecting this database was
#' the explosion of the USA Space Shuttle Challenger on 28 January, 1986. An
#' investigation ensued into the reliability of the shuttle's propulsion system.
#' The explosion was eventually traced to the failure of one of the three field
#' joints on one of the two solid booster rockets. Each of these six field
#' joints includes two O-rings, designated as primary and secondary, which fail
#' when phenomena called erosion and blowby both occur. The night before the
#' launch a decision had to be made regarding launch safety. The discussion
#' among engineers and managers leading to this decision included concern that
#' the probability of failure of the O-rings depended on the temperature t at
#' launch, which was forecase to be 31 degrees F. There are strong engineering
#' reasons based on the composition of O-rings to support the judgment that
#' failure probability may rise monotonically as temperature drops. One other
#' variable, the pressure at which safety testing for field join leaks was
#' performed, was available, but its relevance to the failure process was
#' unclear.

#' The third Bats dataset
#'
#' The dataset describes the vocal activity of Noctule bats in autumn time in
#' Eastern Ukraine. Not long ago, bats were migrating to the south
#' to get food before hibernation, but now they stay where they were born for
#' hibernation and become sedentary. The goal is to understand which
#' environmental variables predict their level of activity (the column "calls"
#' which contain a number of recorded calls which bats emit in flight at the
#' site) and the probability of feeding (the column "buzz" represent 0 and 1 of
#' presence/absence of specific feeding calls, which confirm feeding activity at
#' the site). However, the data could be zero-inflated and yet the probability
#' of buzz usually will be related to the presence of vocal activity first.

#' Rat weight over time for different diets (adapted from package nlme)
#'
#' The \code{BodyWeight} data frame has 176 rows and 4 columns.
#'
#'  Hand and Crowder (1996) describe data on the body weights of rats
#'  measured over 64 days.  These data also appear in Table 2.4 of
#'  Crowder and Hand (1990).  The body weights of the rats (in grams)
#'  are measured on day 1 and every seven days thereafter until day 64,
#'  with an extra measurement on day 44. The experiment started several
#'  weeks before ``day 1.''  There are three groups of rats, each on a
#'  different diet.

#' This data frame contains the following columns:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{weight}{
#'         a numeric vector giving the body weight of the rat (grams).
#'     }
#'     \item{Time}{
#'         a numeric vector giving the time at which the measurement is
#'         made (days).

#'     \item{Rat}{
#'         an factor identifying the rat whose weight is measured.
#'     }
#'     \item{Diet}{
#'         a factor with levels \code{1} to \code{3} indicating the diet that the rat receives.

#' Split-plot Experiment on Varieties of Oats (adapted from package nlme)
#'
#' The \code{Oats} data frame has 72 rows and 4 columns.
#'
#'  These data have been introduced by Yates (1935) as an example of a
#'  split-plot design. The treatment structure used in the experiment was
#'  a \eqn{3 \times 4}{3 x 4} full factorial, with three varieties of oats
#'  and four concentrations of nitrogen. The experimental units were
#'  arranged into six blocks, each with three whole-plots subdivided into
#'  four subplots. The varieties of oats were assigned randomly to the
#'  whole-plots and the concentrations of nitrogen to the subplots.  All
#'  four concentrations of nitrogen were used on each whole-plot.
